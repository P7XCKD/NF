### Describe various methods/types of Business Analytics with suitable example. **6M**  




> [!abstract] 1. Descriptive Analytics
> 
> This is about looking at what already happened. It answers the question, "What happened?" by summarizing past data into easy-to-read reports and dashboards.
> 
> -   **Example**: A bakery looks at its sales data from last month to see which bread was the most popular.
>     

***

> [!abstract] 2. Diagnostic Analytics
> 
> This type explains why something happened. It digs into the data to find the root cause of an event. It answers the question, "Why did it happen?"
> 
> -   **Example**: The bakery's sales dropped. Diagnostic analytics would show that the drop was because a key ingredient for their most popular bread was unavailable.
>     

***

> [!abstract] 3. Predictive Analytics
> 
> This is about forecasting what will happen next. It uses historical data to predict future outcomes. It answers the question, "What will happen?"
> 
> -   **Example**: The bakery uses past sales data to predict how many loaves of bread they will sell next week.
>     

***

> [!abstract] 4. Prescriptive Analytics
> 
> This is the most advanced type. It not only predicts what will happen but also recommends the best action to take. It answers the question, "What should we do?"
> 
> -   **Example**: The bakery's system analyzes upcoming weather, local events, and past sales to recommend the exact number of each type of bread to bake to avoid waste and maximize profit.

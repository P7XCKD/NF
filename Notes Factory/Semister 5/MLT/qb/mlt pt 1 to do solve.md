| Definition     | AI is the simulation of human intelligence by machines.          | ML is a part of AI where machines learn from data.           | DL is a part of ML that uses neural networks to learn patterns automatically. |
| Approach       | AI uses rules, logic, or learning to solve problems.             | ML uses algorithms to improve performance from data.         | DL uses multi-layered neural networks to learn features automatically. |
| Data Required  | AI can work with or without data.                                | ML requires structured data.                                  | DL requires large amounts of data.                         |
| Examples       | Chatbots and expert systems are examples of AI.                  | Spam detection and predictive analytics are examples of ML.   | Image and speech recognition are examples of DL.           |

### Explain Supervised Learning – Working, Types, Advantages, and Disadvantages – 4/6 Marks  

**Supervised Learning** is a machine learning approach that uses **labeled data**, where each input is paired with the correct output. The algorithm learns the relationship between inputs and outputs by building a mapping function. Once trained, the model can predict results for unseen data. For example, it can predict a student’s marks based on the number of study hours.

> **Working**
 
 -   The algorithm is trained on a dataset that is already labeled, meaning each piece of data is tagged with the correct answer.
    
 -   The goal is to learn a function that maps input variables to an output variable.
     
 -   After training, the model can make predictions on new, unlabeled data.
     

> **Types**

1.  **Regression:** In regression problems, the output is a **continuous value**.
    
    -   _Example:_ Predicting house prices, stock values, or temperature.
        
2.  **Classification:** In classification problems, the output belongs to a **category or label**.
    
    -   _Example:_ Classifying emails as spam or not spam, or diagnosing whether a patient has a disease.
        

> [!abstract] any 3 if 6 marks else 2 **Advantages of Supervised Learning**
> 
> -   The model can predict the output on the basis of prior experiences, which improves accuracy in decision-making.
>     
> -   We can have a clear and exact idea about the classes of objects since the data is already labeled.
>     
> -   Supervised learning models help us solve various real-world problems such as fraud detection, spam filtering, and medical diagnosis.
>     

> [!abstract] any 3 if 6 marks else 2 **Disadvantages of Supervised Learning**
> 
> -   The models are not suitable for handling very complex tasks because they require a large amount of high-quality labeled data.
>     
> -   Supervised learning cannot always predict the correct output if the test data is significantly different from the training dataset.
>     
> -   Training supervised models requires a lot of computation time and processing resources, especially with large datasets.
>     
> -   We need sufficient knowledge about the classes of objects to prepare accurate labeled datasets.

### Applications of Supervised / Unsupervised / Reinforcement Learning – 3/4 Marks  
**Supervised Learning** is used for tasks where the data is already labeled.

> [!abstract] Applications
> 
> -   **Image & Spam Recognition:** Classifying emails as spam or not, or identifying objects in images.
>     
> -   **Fraud Detection:** Flagging fraudulent transactions based on past data.
>     
> -   **Predictive Analysis:** Forecasting weather, stock prices, or house prices.
>     

**Unsupervised Learning** is used to find hidden patterns in unlabeled data.

> [!abstract] Applications
> 
> -   **Customer Segmentation:** Grouping customers with similar behaviors for marketing.
>     
> -   **Anomaly Detection:** Identifying unusual patterns in data for security or diagnostics.
>     
> -   **Recommendation Systems:** Suggesting products or content to users based on their browsing history.
>     

**Reinforcement Learning** is a machine learning technique where an agent learns to make decisions by receiving **rewards** and **penalties** for its **actions**, improving through trial and error.

> [!abstract] Applications
> 
> -   **Robotics:** Training robots to perform complex tasks like walking or grabbing objects.
>     
> -   **Autonomous Driving:** Helping self-driving cars make real-time decisions.
>     
> -   **Game AI:** Developing AI agents that can play games and beat human players (e.g., AlphaGo).

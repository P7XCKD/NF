### Comparison of AI, ML, and DL

| Feature        | Artificial Intelligence (AI)                                      | Machine Learning (ML)                                          | Deep Learning (DL)                                          |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Definition     | AI is the simulation of human intelligence by machines.          | ML is a part of AI where machines learn from data.           | DL is a part of ML that uses neural networks to learn patterns automatically. |
| Approach       | AI uses rules, logic, or learning to solve problems.             | ML uses algorithms to improve performance from data.         | DL uses multi-layered neural networks to learn features automatically. |
| Data Required  | AI can work with or without data.                                | ML requires structured data.                                  | DL requires large amounts of data.                         |
| Examples       | Chatbots and expert systems are examples of AI.                  | Spam detection and predictive analytics are examples of ML.   | Image and speech recognition are examples of DL.           |

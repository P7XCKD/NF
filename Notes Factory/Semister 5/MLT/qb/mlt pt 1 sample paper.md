### **Version 1: Paper Based on Syllabus Weightage**

This version is designed to reflect the mark distribution provided in the specification table (Ch1: ~6 Marks, Ch2: ~8 Marks, Ch3: ~16 Marks).

**Sample Question Paper (Weightage-Based)**
**Subject:** Machine Learning
**Total Marks:** 30
**Time:** 1.5 Hours

---

**Q.1 Attempt any FOUR of the following. [4 x 4 = 16 Marks]**

a)  **(Ch 1)** Explain **Overfitting** and **Underfitting** in machine learning with the help of a suitable example or diagram.

b)  **(Ch 2)** How can you create a **DataFrame** in Pandas? Give an example showing at least two different methods.

c)  **(Ch 2)** Explain the main steps involved in the **Scikit-Learn modelling process**, from data preparation to model evaluation.

d)  **(Ch 3)** A model's predictions and the actual values are given below. Calculate the **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.
    * Actual Values: [3, 4, 5, 2]
    * Predicted Values: [2.5, 4.5, 4.5, 3]

e)  **(Ch 3)** Explain the **Naïve Bayes algorithm**. Why is it called 'Naïve'? State the formula for the Bayes theorem.

**Q.2 Attempt any ONE of the following. [1 x 6 = 6 Marks]**

a)  **(Ch 1)** Differentiate between **Training Data**, **Validation Data**, and **Testing Data**. Explain the purpose of each set in developing a machine learning model.

b)  **(Ch 3)** Explain the concept of a **dummy variable** with a clear example. Why is it necessary to use dummy variables in regression analysis?

---

**Q.3 Attempt any ONE of the following. [1 x 8 = 8 Marks]**

a)  **(Ch 2)** i) Explain how to create a **line plot** and a **histogram** using Matplotlib with syntax and a brief example. (4 Marks)
    ii) Describe two **statistical plots** and two **categorical plots** available in the Seaborn library with their use cases. (4 Marks)

b)  **(Ch 3)** Explain **Multiple Linear Regression**. Given a dataset with two independent variables (X1, X2) and one dependent variable (Y), write down the general equation and describe how you would interpret the coefficients. (A sample problem with values can be included here for calculation).

### **Version 2: Paper Based on Equal Weightage**

This version distributes the marks equally across the first three chapters (10 marks from each chapter).

**Sample Question Paper (Equal-Weightage)**
**Subject:** Machine Learning
**Total Marks:** 30
**Time:** 1.5 Hours

a)  **(Ch 1)** Compare **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **Deep Learning (DL)**.

b)  **(Ch 1)** Explain **Reinforcement Learning**. State two of its advantages and two disadvantages.

c)  **(Ch 2)** Explain how to create a **line plot**, **scatter plot**, and **bar chart** using the Matplotlib library. Provide the basic syntax for each.

d)  **(Ch 2)** What is the purpose of the `train_test_split()` function in Scikit-Learn? Explain its key parameters.

e)  **(Ch 3)** Given the following **Confusion Matrix** for a binary classification model, calculate:
    i) Accuracy
    ii) Misclassification/Error Rate
    iii) Precision
    iv) Recall (Sensitivity)
    
|               | Predicted: YES | Predicted: NO |
| :------------ | :------------: | :-----------: |
| **Actual: YES** |       50       |       10      |
| **Actual: NO** |       5        |      100      |

---

**Q.3 Attempt any ONE of the following. [1 x 8 = 8 Marks]**

a)  **(Ch 2)** i) Explain the process of **data cleaning** in Pandas, covering how to handle missing values and duplicates. Provide code snippets. (4 Marks)
    ii) Describe how **Numpy array slicing** and **reshaping** work. Provide a clear example for each operation on a 2D array. (4 Marks)

b)  **(Ch 3)** Using the direct method, calculate **Karl Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient** for the following dataset and interpret the result. (A table with X and Y values would be provided here).

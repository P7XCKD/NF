Alright, with a 6 PM start, the plan is adjusted. We are in triage mode. The goal is not to learn everything, but to maximize marks with the knowledge you already have.
Don't panic. You can already solve 80% of problems with formulas. This means the logic is in your head. Now we just need to burn the essentials into your short-term memory.
Here is your emergency study schedule. Follow it.
Phase 1: The Golden Hours (6:00 PM - 9:00 PM)
Focus: Chapter 3 - Supervised Learning (Highest Weightage: 24 Marks)
This is where you will score the most marks. Focus entirely on the numerical problems.
> [!abstract]
> Action Plan:
>  * Create an Emergency Formula Sheet: On a single piece of paper, write down ONLY the formulas for the following:
>    * MAE, MSE, and RMSE.
>    * Karl Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient.
>    * The formula for a Multiple Linear Regression line (Y = b_0 + b_1X_1 + b_2X_2 + ...).
>    * Confusion Matrix calculations: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F-Measure, Specificity.
>    * Naïve Bayes Theorem (P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}).
>    * Cohen Kappa Coefficient.
>  * Practice One of Each: Take ONE solved example for each formula above. Cover the solution and solve it yourself on a fresh page. If you get stuck, peek. Then, do it again from memory.
>  * DO NOT try to learn new theory right now. Your entire focus for this block is to be able to apply these money-making formulas from memory.
> 
Phase 2: Quick Revision (9:30 PM - 11:30 PM)
Focus: Key Theory & Library Concepts (Chapters 1 & 2)
You won't master these chapters, but you can secure easy marks from definitions. (Take a 30-minute break before starting this phase).
> [!abstract]
> Action Plan:
>  * Ch 1 - Core Concepts: Read and be able to write 2-3 bullet points for:
>    * Overfitting and Underfitting: (Crucial concept!) What they are and how to identify them.
>    * Supervised vs. Unsupervised vs. Reinforcement Learning: A one-sentence definition for each.
>    * Train, Validation, and Test Data: The purpose of each.
>  * Ch 2 - Library Purpose: Don't worry about perfect syntax. Just know the purpose.
>    * Pandas DataFrame: What is it? (A table, like a spreadsheet).
>    * Matplotlib/Seaborn: What are they for? (Plotting/visualizing data). Know what a line plot, bar chart, and histogram are used for.
>    * Scikit-Learn train_test_split(): What does it do? (Splits data into training and testing sets).
> 
Phase 3: Final Review & Shutdown (11:30 PM - 12:00 AM)
> Read your Emergency Formula Sheet one last time. Glance over your 2-3 bullet points for the theory concepts. That's it. Stop studying at midnight.
> 
CRITICAL: Sleep (12:00 AM - 6:30 AM)
> You MUST sleep. An all-nighter will destroy your ability to recall the formulas you just memorized. Sleep solidifies memory. This is the most important part of the plan. Set an alarm and put your phone away.
> 
Morning of Exam (7:00 AM - 8:15 AM)
>  * DO NOT LEARN ANYTHING NEW. It will only create panic and confusion.
>  * While having a light breakfast, calmly read through your Emergency Formula Sheet one more time.
>  * Mentally walk through the steps of solving a confusion matrix problem.
>  * Stop studying by 8:15 AM.
> 
Exam Strategy
 * First 5 Minutes: Read the entire question paper. Identify the numerical problems from Chapter 3 that you practiced.
 * Attack First: Solve the high-mark numerical problems you are 100% confident in. This will secure a big chunk of marks and boost your confidence.
 * Manage Time: If you get stuck, move on. Come back later if you have time.
 * Attempt Everything: For theory questions, write down what you know in your own words. Partial marks are better than zero.
You are in a good position to pass and even score well. Trust the knowledge you have. Good luck!

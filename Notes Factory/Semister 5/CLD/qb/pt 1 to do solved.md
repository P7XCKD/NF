## Chapter 1

- [x]   Q.1) 
### Define the term virtualization. Enlist and describe any 4 advantages of virtualization in brief.   **4M**
**Virtualization:**  is the ability of a computer program  (which can be combination of software and hardwar) to emulate an executing environment separate from the one that hosts such programs.  
_Example:_ We can run Linux OS in Windows OS itself through a virtual Machines

**Advantages of Virtualization:**

1.  **Cost Savings** – Virtualization allows multiple operating systems and applications to run on a single physical server, reducing the need for extra hardware, lowering electricity consumption, and minimizing maintenance expenses.
    
2.  **Efficient Resource Utilization** – Physical hardware resources like CPU, RAM, and storage are shared among virtual machines, ensuring higher utilization rates and avoiding idle resources.
    
3.  **Scalability & Flexibility** – Virtual machines can be easily created, modified, or migrated to meet changing workload requirements without purchasing new hardware.
    
4.  **Improved Disaster Recovery** – Virtual machines can be quickly backed up, replicated, and restored on other servers, In case of system crashes or site failures.

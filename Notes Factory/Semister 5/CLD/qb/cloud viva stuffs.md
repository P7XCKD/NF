# Cloud Computing Viva Notes

## 1. What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services like servers, storage, databases, networking, and software over the internet (“the cloud”). It allows users to access resources on demand without owning hardware.  
**Example:** Using Google Drive to store files instead of saving them on your PC.

---

## 2. Difference Between Private and Public Cloud
- **Public Cloud:** Services are shared and offered over the internet by providers like AWS or Google Cloud.  
  **Example:** Gmail, AWS EC2.  
- **Private Cloud:** Used by a single organization, offering more control and security.  
  **Example:** A bank using its own private servers for data management.

---

## 3. SaaS, PaaS, IaaS (Cloud Service Models)
- **SaaS (Software as a Service):** Ready-made software over the internet.  
  **Example:** Gmail, Microsoft 365.  
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service):** Provides tools/platform to develop and deploy apps.  
  **Example:** Google App Engine.  
- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):** Provides virtualized computing resources like servers and storage.  
  **Example:** AWS EC2.

## 4. What is Virtualization?
Virtualization is the process of creating a virtual version of hardware or software resources like servers, storage, or networks. It allows multiple operating systems to run on one physical machine.  
**Example:** Running both Windows and Linux on the same PC using VMware.

---

## 5. Advantages of Virtualization
- Better hardware utilization  
- Easier backup and recovery  
- Isolation between systems  
- Lower cost and energy usage  
**Example:** Hosting multiple virtual servers on a single physical server.

---

## 6. What is a Hypervisor?
A hypervisor is software that creates and runs virtual machines by dividing hardware resources.  
**Example:** VMware, Oracle VirtualBox.

---

## 7. What is VMM (Virtual Machine Monitor)?
VMM is another name for a **hypervisor** — it monitors and manages multiple virtual machines running on the same physical system.  
**Example:** Microsoft Hyper-V acts as a VMM managing all virtual machines on Windows Server.

---

## 8. Parallel and Distributed Computing (Difference)
- **Parallel Computing:** Multiple processors execute tasks **simultaneously** within the same system.  
  **Example:** A multi-core CPU processing parts of a task at the same time.  
- **Distributed Computing:** Tasks are divided among **multiple computers** connected through a network.  
  **Example:** Google Search uses many computers across data centers to process queries.

---

## 9. Encryption vs Hashing
- **Encryption:** Converts plain text into unreadable text using a key; can be **decrypted back**.  
  **Example:** AES encryption for securing files.  
- **Hashing:** Converts data into a fixed-length hash; **cannot be reversed**.  
  **Example:** Passwords stored using SHA-256 hash.

---

## 10. AWS (Amazon Web Services)
AWS is a leading cloud platform providing on-demand cloud computing services like storage, databases, and machine learning tools.  
**Example:** Hosting a website using AWS EC2 and S3.

---

## 11. EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
EC2 is a service from AWS that provides virtual servers (instances) for running applications in the cloud.  
**Example:** Launching a virtual Linux server on AWS to host a website.

---

## 12. CloudZero
CloudZero is a **cloud cost management platform** that helps organizations monitor, analyze, and reduce cloud spending efficiently.  
**Example:** A company using CloudZero to track AWS costs per project.

---

## 13. Datadog
Datadog is a **cloud monitoring and security platform** that provides real-time observability for servers, apps, and databases.  
**Example:** Monitoring CPU usage and network traffic of AWS instances using Datadog.

### **Aim:**  
To prepare SQA plan for quality of process and product

---

### **Theory:**  
**SQA plan**  
Software Quality Assurance (SQA) ensures the quality and reliability of software by monitoring engineering processes throughout the development lifecycle, from requirements to release.

**SQAP** (Software Quality Assurance Plan) includes procedures, techniques, and tools to ensure a product aligns with the SRS (Software Requirement Specification).

**Benefits of SQA:**  
- Produces high-quality software  
- Saves time and cost  
- Improves reliability  
- Reduces long-term maintenance needs  
- Increases market share  
- Enhances development process  
- Cuts maintenance costs

### **Procedure:**  

**Phases of SQA:**  
1. Create SQA Management Plan  
2. Set periodic quality checkpoints  
3. Support requirement gathering  
4. Conduct Formal Technical Reviews  
5. Formulate Multi-Testing Strategy  
6. Enforce Process Adherence  
   - 6.1 Process Evaluation  
   - 6.2 Process Monitoring  
7. Control Change  
8. Measure Change Impact  
9. Perform SQA Audits  
10. Manage Good Relations

### **Techniques of SQA:**  
- **Auditing**  
- **Reviewing**  
- **Code Inspection**  
- **Design Inspection:** General requirements, functional/interface specs, conventions, requirement traceability, structures, logic, performance, error handling, testability, coupling/cohesion  
- **Simulation**  
- **Functional Testing (Black Box)**  
- **Standardization**  
- **Static Analysis**  
- **Walkthroughs:** Peer review guided by developer for feedback and error detection  
- **Unit Testing (White Box):** Ensures full code coverage  
- **Stress Testing:** Tests system under heavy load

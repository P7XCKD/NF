### **Aim:**  
To generate a detailed bug report using a bug tracking tool (JIRA).

---

### **Theory:**  
A **bug report** is a formal document that communicates details about software or hardware faults. It helps the development team understand, reproduce, and fix issues efficiently. A well-structured bug report ensures quick resolution and improves overall software quality.  

A good bug report generally includes the following elements:  

- **Title / Bug ID:** A short and clear identifier that briefly describes the issue.  
- **Environment:** Information about the system setup where the issue occurred—hardware configuration, operating system, browser type and version, software version, and other relevant parameters.  
- **Steps to Reproduce:** A list of precise, sequential steps required to consistently trigger the issue. Clear steps help developers replicate the problem easily and identify the root cause.  
- **Expected Result:** The output that should appear if the system behaves correctly.  
- **Actual Result:** The behavior that actually occurred during testing.  
- **Visual Proof:** Screenshots, videos, or logs that provide visual evidence of the bug’s occurrence.  
- **Severity and Priority:** Helps determine the urgency and impact of the issue.  

**Bug Severity Levels:**  
- **Low:** Minor issue, does not affect overall functionality.  
- **Minor:** Causes slight undesired behavior but system remains usable.  
- **Major:** Affects significant parts of the system or leads to partial failure.  
- **Critical:** May cause total system failure or prevent main functionality.  

**Bug Priority Levels:**  
- **Low:** Can be fixed later after more critical issues.  
- **Medium:** Should be resolved in normal development cycles.  
- **High:** Must be fixed immediately as it blocks system use.

### **JIRA:**  
**JIRA** is one of the most popular and widely used **bug tracking and project management tools** developed by Atlassian. It allows teams to **report, track, assign, and resolve** issues efficiently. JIRA also supports workflow customization, time tracking, reporting, and team collaboration.  

**Key Features of JIRA:**  
- Issue and project tracking  
- Workflow customization  
- Reporting and progress tracking  
- Team collaboration and communication tools  
- Integration with version control systems

### **Steps to Log a Bug in JIRA:**  
1. **Sign Up and Log In** to JIRA using an Atlassian account.  
2. **Create a New Project** using the “Bug Tracking” template.  
3. **Add Project Details** like project name, description, and key.  
4. **Create a New Issue** – describe the bug clearly with title, environment, and steps to reproduce.  
5. **Add Subtasks** to divide larger bugs into smaller, manageable tasks.  
6. **Update Progress** as the issue moves through the workflow (To Do → In Progress → Done).  
7. **Assign Tasks and Set Priority** to developers or testers for efficient resolution.  
8. **Enable Time Tracking** to record effort spent on bug fixes.  
9. **Create a Team and Invite Members** – all members must have Atlassian accounts.  
10. **Add Members to the Project** to assign responsibilities and manage collaboration.

### **Conclusion:**  
Using **JIRA** for bug reporting streamlines the entire software testing process. It helps testers record, track, and manage bugs efficiently while improving coordination among team members. Overall, JIRA enhances project transparency, reduces resolution time, and contributes to higher-quality software delivery.

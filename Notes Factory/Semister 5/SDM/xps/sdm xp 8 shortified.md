### **Aim:**  
To generate a bug report using a bug tracking tool (JIRA).  

---

### **Theory:**  
A **bug report** documents faults or malfunctions in software/hardware. It helps developers identify, reproduce, and fix issues efficiently.  

A good bug report includes:  
- **Title/Bug ID:** Unique identifier of the issue.  
- **Environment:** System setup details (OS, version, browser, etc.).  
- **Steps to Reproduce:** Clear steps to replicate the issue.  
- **Expected vs Actual Result:** Describes what should happen and what actually occurred.  
- **Visual Proof:** Screenshots or videos showing the bug.  
- **Bug Severity & Priority:**  
  - **Severity Levels:** Low, Minor, Major, Critical.  
  - **Priority Levels:** Low (fix later), Medium (fix during testing), High (fix immediately).

### **JIRA:**  
**JIRA** is an open-source tool used for **bug tracking, issue tracking, and project management**. It supports workflow management, reporting, and collaboration between testers and developers.  

**Steps to log a bug in JIRA:**  
1. Sign up and log in to JIRA.  
2. Create a new project using a Bug Tracking Template.  
3. Add project details.  
4. Create a new issue and describe the bug.  
5. Add subtasks if needed.  
6. Update progress and assign priorities.  
7. Set time tracking.  
8. Create a team and invite members (they must have Atlassian accounts).  
9. Add members to the project for task assignment.

### **Conclusion:**  
Bug reporting through **JIRA** enables efficient tracking, prioritization, and resolution of software issues, improving overall project quality and collaboration.

Q.1 Explain any six factors that influence the choice of a programming language for software development. 6M
> The selection of a programming language is a critical decision in software development that depends on various technical and business requirements. The right choice can significantly impact development speed, application performance, and long-term maintenance.
> 
> [!abstract]
> Key Factors Influencing Language Choice
>  * Project Requirements: The type of application being built is a primary factor. For instance, Python or R are preferred for data science and machine learning, while JavaScript is essential for front-end web development, and Swift or Kotlin are used for native mobile apps.
>  * Performance: For applications requiring high speed and efficiency, such as game engines or high-frequency trading systems, languages like C++ or Rust are chosen due to their close-to-hardware performance and memory management capabilities.
>  * Ecosystem and Libraries: A strong ecosystem with a rich set of libraries, frameworks, and tools can drastically speed up development. Languages like Python (with Django, Flask) and JavaScript (with React, Node.js) have vast ecosystems that provide pre-built solutions for common problems.
>  * Developer Availability and Skillset: The choice may depend on the expertise of the development team. Choosing a language familiar to the team reduces training time and costs. The availability of skilled developers in the market for a particular language is also a crucial consideration.
>  * Scalability: The language should support the future growth of the application. Languages like Go and Java are known for their excellent support for concurrency and are often used to build large-scale, distributed systems that can handle many users simultaneously.
>  * Community and Support: A large and active developer community provides valuable support through forums, documentation, and tutorials. Popular open-source languages like Python, Java, and JavaScript have strong communities that help developers solve problems quickly and keep the language updated.

Q.2 State any four uses of programming languages and mention one real-world application for each. 4M
> Programming languages are the tools used to create software applications that run on various devices. They can be used to build everything from simple websites to complex artificial intelligence systems.
> 
> [!abstract]
> Uses of Programming Languages
>  * Web Development: Used to create websites and web applications.
>    * Application: Building e-commerce platforms like Amazon using languages such as JavaScript, Python, and Java.
>  * Mobile App Development: Used to build applications for smartphones and tablets.
>    * Application: Developing social media apps like Instagram using Swift (for iOS) and Kotlin (for Android).
>  * Data Science and Machine Learning: Used to analyze data, create predictive models, and build AI systems.
>    * Application: Powering the recommendation engine on Netflix, which suggests movies and shows based on user viewing history, using Python.
>  * Game Development: Used to create video games for consoles, PCs, and mobile devices.
>    * Application: Developing popular games like Fortnite using the C++ language with the Unreal Engine.

Q.3 Write any four Purpose of Having Coding Standards. 4M
> Coding standards are a set of rules, guidelines, and best practices for a specific programming language. They ensure that all developers on a team write code in a consistent and uniform style.
> 
> [!abstract]
> Purpose of Coding Standards
>  * Improved Readability and Consistency: When all team members follow the same standards for naming, formatting, and structuring code, the entire codebase becomes uniform and easier to read. This helps developers understand each other's work quickly.
>  * Enhanced Maintainability: Consistent code is easier to debug, modify, and update. New developers can understand the existing codebase faster, reducing the time it takes to fix bugs or add new features.
>  * Reduced Complexity: Standards often discourage overly complex or "clever" code, promoting simpler, more straightforward solutions. This reduces the cognitive load on developers and minimizes the chances of introducing errors.
>  * Facilitates Team Collaboration: Coding standards create a common language for developers. This eliminates disagreements over style and formatting, allowing the team to focus on solving actual business problems and improving productivity.
> 
Q.4 List any four commonly followed coding standards in software development. Explain the purpose of each. 4M
> Commonly followed coding standards are practical rules that guide the day-to-day process of writing code, ensuring quality and consistency across a project.
> 
> [!abstract]
> Common Coding Standards
>  * Naming Conventions: This standard defines how variables, functions, classes, and other identifiers should be named (e.g., using camelCase for variables and PascalCase for classes).
>    * Purpose: To make the code self-documenting and intuitive, allowing developers to understand the purpose of an identifier just by its name.
>  * Indentation and Formatting: This standard specifies rules for code layout, such as using tabs or spaces for indentation, line length, and the placement of braces.
>    * Purpose: To ensure the code has a clean and consistent visual structure, making it easier to read and understand the logical flow.
>  * Commenting: This provides guidelines on when and how to write comments to explain parts of the code. It often specifies a format for documenting functions and modules.
>    * Purpose: To clarify complex logic, explain the "why" behind a piece of code, and help other developers (or the future self) understand its functionality without having to decipher it from scratch.
>  * File and Folder Organization: This standard dictates how source code files should be organized into directories and packages.
>    * Purpose: To create a logical and predictable project structure, making it easy for developers to locate specific files and understand the overall architecture of the application.
> 
Q.5 Write any four advantages of Coding Guidelines. 4M
> Coding guidelines are recommendations and best practices that help developers write high-quality code. Adhering to these guidelines brings significant benefits to the software development lifecycle.
> 
> [!abstract]
> Advantages of Coding Guidelines
>  * Improved Code Quality: Guidelines promote practices that lead to more robust, efficient, and reliable code. This results in software with fewer defects and better performance.
>  * Easier Onboarding of New Developers: A well-documented set of coding guidelines helps new team members get up to speed quickly. They can learn the team's conventions and start contributing meaningful code sooner.
>  * Increased Efficiency: When code is consistent and predictable, developers spend less time deciphering it and more time on development tasks. This boosts overall team productivity and speeds up the delivery of features.
>  * Simplified Code Reviews: During code reviews, teams can focus on the logic and functionality of the code rather than debating stylistic preferences. This makes the review process faster and more effective.
> 
Q.6 Describe any four important coding guidelines that help in writing clean, maintainable, and error-free code. 4M
> Following key coding guidelines is essential for creating a professional and sustainable software product. These principles help prevent common pitfalls and ensure the codebase remains healthy over time.
> 
> [!abstract]
> Important Coding Guidelines
>  * Keep Functions Small and Focused (Single Responsibility Principle): Each function or method should do one thing and do it well. A function should not be overly long or handle multiple, unrelated tasks. This makes the code easier to test, debug, and understand.
>  * Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY): Avoid duplicating code in multiple places. Instead, abstract common logic into a reusable function or class. This reduces redundancy, and if a change is needed, it only has to be made in one place, minimizing the risk of errors.
>  * Use Meaningful Names: Variable, function, and class names should be descriptive and unambiguous. A name like calculateInterest is far better than calcInt or ci. Clear names make the code self-explanatory and reduce the need for excessive comments.
>  * Write Comments Where Necessary: While code should be as self-documenting as possible, comments are crucial for explaining complex algorithms, business logic, or the reasoning behind a specific implementation choice. Good comments explain why something is done, not what is done.

PERT and CPM:
PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) and CPM (Critical Path Method) are project management tools used to plan and schedule project activities. PERT focuses on time estimation for uncertain tasks using optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely times, while CPM is used for projects with known activity durations. For example, in software development, PERT can help estimate testing timelines, and CPM can find the critical path to ensure the project is completed on time.

DFD Diagram:
A Data Flow Diagram (DFD) represents how data moves through a system. It shows processes, data stores, and external entities with the flow of information between them. For example, in a hospital management system, a DFD can show patient details entering the system, being processed by the “Appointment” module, and stored in the “Patient Database.”

Alpha and Beta Testing:
Alpha testing is done by internal developers and testers to identify bugs before the product is released to users. Beta testing is done by real users in a real environment to check the software’s performance and usability. For example, before launching a hospital management app, the company tests it internally (alpha), then gives it to selected doctors or staff to test (beta).

Unit Testing and Integration Testing:
Unit testing checks individual modules or functions of the software separately to ensure each part works correctly. Integration testing checks how those modules work together as a whole. For example, in a hospital system, unit testing tests the “Login” module alone, while integration testing ensures the “Login” and “Appointment” modules work together properly.

Software Models (Waterfall, Agile, etc.):
The Waterfall model is a linear model where each phase (requirement, design, coding, testing, maintenance) happens step by step. It’s simple but not flexible. The Agile model is iterative, meaning development happens in small cycles (sprints) with continuous feedback from users. Agile is best because it allows flexibility and faster updates based on real feedback.

Black Box, White Box, and Grey Box Testing:
Black box testing checks the software’s functionality without knowing internal code — testers only focus on input and output. White box testing checks the internal code logic and structure. Grey box testing is a mix of both, where the tester has partial knowledge of the internal system. For example, a tester verifying only login success/failure does black box testing, while a developer checking the login code flow does white box testing.

SRS Document:
The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document describes what the system should do. It includes functional and non-functional requirements, use cases, inputs, outputs, and constraints. For example, an SRS for a hospital management system would specify that “The system should allow patients to book appointments online” as a functional requirement.

SQA Plan:
A Software Quality Assurance (SQA) Plan defines the activities, standards, and procedures used to ensure the software meets quality goals. It covers testing methods, quality metrics, roles, and review processes. For example, the SQA plan for a hospital system ensures every module — like billing or patient records — is tested for accuracy, security, and performance before release.

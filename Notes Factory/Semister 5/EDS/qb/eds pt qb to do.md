## CHAPTER 1: Entrepreneurship & Start-ups (CO 1) {10 Marks}

---

- [ ] Q.1  
### Define Entrepreneurship and Start-up. **4M**

**Entrepreneurship** is the act of starting a new business and taking on the risks that come with it. It's about being a problem-solver who sees an opportunity and creates a business to make money from it. It's a way of thinking that values creativity and being a leader.

**Example:** A graphic designer decides to start their own freelance business. They are an **entrepreneur** because they are building a business, managing it, and taking on the financial risk to make a profit.

***

A **start-up** is a brand-new company built with the goal of growing very quickly and becoming a huge business. They often use new technology to create a product or service that can be sold to many people around the world. Unlike a typical small business, start-ups are usually not profitable at first and need to get a lot of money from investors to fuel their rapid growth.

**Example:** Airbnb was a start-up. They created a new way for people to rent out rooms in their homes. The goal was never to be a small, local company; it was to grow rapidly and become a major, global business.

### Describe prototyping and its type in detail with appropriate example? **8M**  



**Prototyping** is the process of creating an early version of a product to test its design and functionality before it is fully developed. It is a physical or digital model used to visualize ideas, get feedback, and find any design problems early on.

***

> [!abstract] Types of Prototypes

-   **Low-Fidelity Prototype:** This is a basic and simple model, often created with minimal time and resources. It focuses on the core concept and structure rather than visual details.
    
    -   **Example:** For a new mobile app, a low-fidelity prototype could be a simple paper drawing of each screen with notes on what happens when a button is tapped. This quickly tests the user flow and overall idea.
        
-   **High-Fidelity Prototype:** This is a more advanced and detailed model that looks and feels very close to the final product. It often includes interactive elements, realistic visuals, and a complete user experience.
    
    -   **Example:** For the same mobile app, a high-fidelity prototype would be a clickable digital version that looks exactly like the finished app. Users can tap through the screens, see animations, and experience the app as if it were real.
        

***

> [!abstract] Importance of Prototyping for a Start-up

-   **Saves Time and Money:** It helps a start-up find and fix flaws in a product's design early, which is much cheaper than correcting mistakes after full production has started.
    
-   **Gathers Feedback:** A prototype can be shown to potential customers and investors to get valuable feedback, ensuring the final product meets market needs.

> [!abstract] Key Differences between CPM and PERT

| Basis of Difference | **CPM (Critical Path Method)** | **PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Focus** | Finds the longest path to finish a project on time. | Manages the uncertainty of project times. |
| **Time Estimate** | Uses a single, definite time for each task. | Uses three time estimates: **best-case**, **worst-case**, and **most common**. |
| **Nature** | Deterministic (task times are known and predictable). | Probabilistic (task times are uncertain). |
| **Use** | For projects with familiar tasks, like construction. | For projects with new, uncertain tasks, like R&D. |
| **Cost** | Focuses on controlling project costs. | Focuses on controlling time. |
| **Example** | Used to schedule a project to build a bridge, as the time for each step is well-known. | Used to schedule a project to design and build a new type of satellite, as the time for each step is unknown. |

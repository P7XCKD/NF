## **SWOT Analysis for Lanvan**

***

### **Strengths & Weaknesses**

| **Strengths** | **Weaknesses** |
| --- | --- |
| High-speed LAN file transfers with adaptive chunking → reliable for large files. | Limited platform coverage (currently desktop/web-first; no mobile apps yet). |
| Secure encryption (AES-256 + HTTPS) ensures safe transfers. | Heavy reliance on LAN connectivity → limited usability outside local networks. |
| Real-time clipboard sharing (text, images, files) enhances collaboration. | Small development team → low parallel capacity, delays affect progress. |
| Cross-device compatibility (Windows, Linux, Mac) with potential for broader expansion. | Vendor dependency on FastAPI/third-party libraries → updates may cause compatibility issues. |
| Lightweight, no external client install needed; browser-first approach. | Performance testing and scalability validation not fully mature. |
| Structured architecture (FastAPI backend + vanilla JS frontend) makes maintenance easier. | Pre-revenue stage; sustainability depends on adoption and funding. |

### **Opportunities & Threats**

| **Opportunities** | **Threats** |
| --- | --- |
| Enterprise adoption in offices, labs, and institutions for secure internal transfers. | Competition from established tools (Google Drive, OneDrive, AirDrop, etc.). |
| Expansion into mobile (Android/iOS) for true cross-platform usage. | Network restrictions (firewalls, strict IT policies) may limit LAN operations. |
| Partnerships with schools, colleges, and SMEs for collaboration. | Risk of misuse (file leaks, malware spread) without strong policies. |
| Offering SaaS/licensed enterprise solutions for secure private networks. | Cloud alternatives offering “anywhere access” could reduce interest in LAN-based tools. |
| Integration with IoT/smart devices for local data sharing. | Security attacks targeting file integrity or spoofed transfers. |
| CSR / educational outreach → open-source contributions & community adoption. | Rapid tech changes may demand frequent updates, adding cost and complexity. |

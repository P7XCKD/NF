## **SWOT Analysis for Rapid Warn**


### **Strengths & Weaknesses**

| **Strengths** | **Weaknesses** |
| --- | --- |
| Real-time notifications & alerts (push + widget) ensure immediate visibility; fast response in emergencies. | High dependency on third-party platforms (Firebase/Supabase) → vendor lock-in, outage, and pricing risks. |
| AI/ML-driven image triage system automates categorization; reduces manual review workload. | ML model limitations: requires large labeled datasets, needs retraining, risk of false positives/negatives. |
| Cloud-based backend enables real-time sync, scalability, and built-in authentication/storage. | Limited human resources → small team, less parallel work, delays cascade on zero-slack path. |
| Cross-platform accessible (Android now, iOS/web possible), cloud-first for global reach. | Mobile-first approach only; missing iOS/web users lowers adoption. |
| Structured project management (CPM/PERT) ensures timely delivery and risk awareness. | Performance testing not on critical path → bottlenecks risk being overlooked. |
| Cost efficiency: Avg burn $190/day; ROI high ($1,525 per deliverable). | —   |

## **Table 2 — Opportunities & Threats**

| **Opportunities** | **Threats** |
| --- | --- |
| Partnerships with agencies/NGOs for verified alerts and wider adoption. | Data privacy & regulatory risks (GDPR, HIPAA, sovereignty laws). |
| Enterprise analytics expansion (dashboards, SaaS subscriptions). | Competition from established emergency platforms & big tech. |
| IoT/sensor integration (weather, seismic, flood) for automated alerts. | Tech dependency: Firebase/Supabase outages or pricing hikes. |
| Geographic expansion to disaster-prone regions with localized support. | Infrastructure strain during mass disasters; scaling costs spike. |
| Open API for third-party developer ecosystem. | Public adoption risks: early ML mistakes reduce trust. |
| CSR/social impact visibility → funding from NGOs, gov, aid groups. | Security vulnerabilities: risk of false alerts from attackers. |

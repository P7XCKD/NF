## **Section A â€” CPM (Critical Path Method)**

### Theory (same as Rapid Warn)

-   Deterministic durations, single fixed time per activity.
    
-   Forward/Backward pass â†’ ES, EF, LS, LF.
    
-   Slack = LS â€“ ES.
    
-   Slack = 0 â†’ Critical Path.

### **Summary Findings (CPM)**

-   **Deterministic project duration** = **72 days**.
    
-   **Critical Path**: 10 activities â†’ covers kickoff, backend, security, transfer engine, frontend, testing, fixes, deployment, monitoring.
    
-   Non-critical tasks (Clipboard, QR, perf test) have **slack**, safe to delay slightly.
    
-   Any delay on **backend/security/transfer/frontend/testing** â†’ directly delays delivery.

## **Section B â€” PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique)**

### Theory

-   O = Optimistic, M = Most likely, P = Pessimistic.
    
-   TE = (O + 4M + P)/6
    
-   Variance = ((P â€“ O)/6)Â²
    

***

### PERT Calculations

**Expected project duration (PERT, TE-based) = 63.8 days**  
**Critical Path same as CPM:** A â†’ B â†’ C â†’ D â†’ F â†’ G â†’ I â†’ K â†’ L â†’ M  
**Critical-path variance â‰ˆ 19.36 daysÂ² â†’ Ïƒ â‰ˆ 4.40 days**

```

***

### Example TE (Activity F: File Transfer Engine)

-   O = 8, M = 12, P = 18
    
-   TE = (8 + 4Ã—12 + 18)/6 = 11.67 days
    
-   Variance = ((18â€“8)/6)Â² = 2.78
    

***

### Probability (target = TE project duration = 63.8 days)

-   Z = 0 â†’ Probability = **50%** (expected baseline).
    
-   For tighter deadlines (<60d) â†’ Z < 0 â†’ lower probability.

## **Section C â€” CPU (Cost-Per-Unit / Cost Analysis)**

### Theory

-   CPU_feature = Total cost Ã· Deliverables
    
-   CostPerDay_i = Cost_i Ã· Duration_i
    
-   AvgBurn = TotalCost Ã· CPM duration
    

***

### Example Cost Analysis for Lanvan

(assume **Total dev cost = â‚¹55,650**. Approx allocation by modules.)

-   Major Deliverables = **7** (Backend, Security, Clipboard, Transfer Engine, Frontend, Testing, Deployment).
    
-   CPU_feature = 55,650 Ã· 7 â‰ˆ **â‚¹7,950 per deliverable**.
    
-   Example CostPerDay:
    
    -   **Core backend (â‚¹12,000, 12d)** â†’ 1,000/day
        
    -   **File Transfer Engine (â‚¹15,000, 12d)** â†’ 1,250/day
        
    -   **Frontend PWA (â‚¹8,000, 10d)** â†’ 800/day
        
-   AvgBurnPerDay = 55,650 Ã· 72 â‰ˆ **â‚¹773/day**

## **Section D â€” PMT (Project Mgmt Tools & Metrics)**

**Agile Metrics for Lanvan**

1.  **Sprint Velocity**
    

-   Suppose 4 sprints: story points = 35, 32, 36, 37
    
-   Total = 140 â†’ Velocity = 35 pts/sprint
    

2.  **Cycle Time (ticket avg)**
    

-   50 tickets closed, sum(Câ€“O)=200 days â†’ CT=200/50=4 days/ticket
    

3.  **Defect Escape Rate**
    

-   Production bugs = 8, Total bugs = 90 â†’ DER = 8.9%
    

4.  **MTTR (Mean Time To Recover)**
    

-   5 incidents, total resolution = 20 hours â†’ MTTR=4h
    

5.  **Release Readiness Checklist (Lanvan)**
    

-   âœ… CI/CD passing
    
-   âœ… File size & MIME validation
    
-   âœ… Encryption tests OK
    
-   âœ… UAT signed off
    
-   âœ… Rollback & monitoring ready
    

***

ðŸ”‘ **Final Interpretation for Lanvan:**

-   CPM = 72 days, PERT = 63.8 days â†’ probabilistic planning better.
    
-   Avg burn = â‚¹773/day, highest costs in backend + transfer engine.
    
-   Agile metrics show stable throughput (~35 SP/sprint).
    
-   Risk = delays in **backend/security/transfer** chain.

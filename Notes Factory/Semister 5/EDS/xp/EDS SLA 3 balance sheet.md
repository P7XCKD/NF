# **EDS SLA 3**

## **Lanvan Balance Sheet**

The Balance Sheet presents Lanvan’s financial position at a given point in time.

It is divided into:

-   **Assets** → resources owned/controlled by the project
    
-   **Liabilities** → obligations owed to others
    
-   **Equity** → founders’ contributions and retained earnings
    

**Rule:**  
**Assets = Liabilities + Equity**

## **Observations**

| Area | Key Finding | Why it Matters | Suggested Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Assets | Largest portion is **development equipment** | Equipment-intensive → supports high-performance file transfers | Maintain and upgrade hardware as needed |
| Liabilities | Small (subscriptions + founder loan) | Low financial risk currently | Track short-term obligations; plan for future scaling costs |
| Equity | Dominates (~73% of total) | Shows strong founder-driven value | Consider future investor equity carefully |
| Revenue | Pre-revenue stage → **retained earnings = 0** | No external income yet | Plan for monetization via enterprise deployments & licensing |
| Growth Potential | IP & core system are major assets | Tech-heavy approach supports scalability | Focus on software optimizations & secure LAN/file transfer modules |

If you want, I can also **add a small “Key Metrics / Notes” section** like CPM/PERT/PMT summary from our previous exercises, so your SLA doc has a complete project financial + planning snapshot. Do you want me to do that?

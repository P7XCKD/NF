### **Lanvan Balance Sheet**

The Balance Sheet shows Lanvan’s financial position at one point in time.  
It is divided into:

-   **Assets** → resources owned/controlled
    
-   **Liabilities** → obligations owed
    
-   **Equity** → founders’ contribution and ownership value
    

Rule:  
**Assets = Liabilities + Equity**

#### **1. Idea Generation**

The idea for the _Personalized Food Navigator_ came from finding a missing piece in the popular market for health apps, especially in cities like Mumbai. We noticed two main things: first, more people have special health needs when it comes to food (like gluten allergies or diabetes). Second, at the same time, many people are using apps for their fitness goals (like keto diets or counting calories).

The problem is for people who belong to both groups. For example, an athlete with a nut allergy has to use one app to stay safe and another app to track their fitness. This is often confusing and annoying. The idea started with a simple question: "Why not make one app that provides both important safety warnings and guidance for a healthy lifestyle?"

#### **2. Idea Description**

The _Personalized Food Navigator_ is a mobile app that uses AI to act as a complete food guide for its users. It helps people with both their medical needs and lifestyle goals.

First, a user makes a detailed health profile in the app, listing their allergies and intolerances, as well as their diet goals like vegan or keto. The app's main feature lets a user scan a product's barcode, take a photo of their meal, or type in a food's name. The app then gives a clear, two-part answer: an instant **'Safe'** or **'Not Safe'** warning for their allergies, and a note on how the food fits their diet plan. In short, it mixes the safety of an allergy app with the tracking features of a diet app.

### Procedure
#### **3. Idea Evaluation**

| Pros (Strengths) | Cons (Weaknesses & Risks) |
| --- | --- |
| **Bigger Customer Base**: The app isn't just for people with allergies; it's also for the much larger group of health-conscious people. | **Tough Competition**: It has to compete with big, successful apps like MyFitnessPal and HealthifyMe. |
| **Unique Feature**: It mixes important allergy safety with diet tracking, which other popular apps don't do. | **Doing Too Much**: Trying to be the best at everything (safety, calorie counting) risks not being very good at any of them. |
| **More User Activity**: Tracking diets every day means people will use the app more often and are more likely to keep using it. | **Hard to Manage Data**: Creating and constantly updating a correct database for millions of foods is a very big and difficult job. |

#### **Viability Analysis**

The idea has a high chance of success, but its big goals make it hard to build. It could be more successful than a simple allergy-only app, but the risks and competition are also higher.

Its key to success is a unique feature that is hard for others to copy: the allergy safety check. Other wellness apps can't easily add this because of the legal risks and the difficulty of keeping data accurate. This safety feature will be the main reason users will trust the app. To succeed, it should be launched in stages. The first simple version (_MVP_) should focus on making the two-part answer system work perfectly for packaged foods by scanning barcodes. This will prove the idea works.

This app aims to win a large part of the health and wellness market by offering a critical feature that others can't easily match.

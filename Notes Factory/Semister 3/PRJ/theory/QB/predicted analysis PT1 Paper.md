**Course**: Programming in JAVA  
**Course Code**: PRJ238913  

**PART 1 - SAMPLE QUESTION PAPER**

**Section A: Short Answer Questions (4 Marks Each)**

1. **Explain the statement:** `public static void main(String args[])`. [4M]  
   *(This is a fundamental question that tests understanding of the entry point of a Java program.)*

2. **Describe primitive data types of Java with appropriate code snippets.** [4M]  
   *(Understanding data types is crucial, as it's fundamental to Java programming.)*

3. **Justify Java is a Platform-independent language while JVM is platform-dependent.** [4M]  
   *(This question often appears due to its importance in understanding Javaâ€™s architecture.)*

4. **Explain the process of object creation in Java.** [4M]  
   *(Object creation is essential for understanding how Java programs operate in memory.)*

5. **Explain Access modifiers in Java.** [4M]  
   *(Access control is critical in object-oriented programming, making this a likely question.)*

**Section B: Intermediate Answer Questions (6 Marks Each)**

1. **Give the OOP principles and explain each with a suitable example.** [6M]  
   *(Core to Java and object-oriented programming, this is a high-probability question.)*

2. **Explain type casting and type conversion with a suitable example program.** [6M]  
   *(Type conversion is essential in Java, especially when dealing with different data types.)*

**Section C: Long Answer Questions (8 Marks Each)**

1. **Explain constructor overloading with an example program.** [8M]  
   *(Constructor overloading is a key concept in OOP, making this a critical area for assessment.)*

2. **Explain passing and returning objects to and from the method (function) with an example program.** [8M]  
   *(This question covers important concepts in method interaction with objects, which is fundamental in Java.)*

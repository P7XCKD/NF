 8. What is the ratio of the numbers of application (http, mail, ftp, …) to numbers of service (dns, icmp, arp, …) protocols?<br><br>Anr 
-   **SMB (Server Message Block Protocol)**: 7 packets
-   **Microsoft Windows Browser Protocol**: 7 packets
-   **Total Anr** = **7 + 7 = 14 packets**

3.6. Exporting File from Traffic Stream

**Tasks.**

You need to find and export the N-th (by size) JPEG file, where N is your number in the class list (the 1st by number takes the largest file, the 2nd takes the next, etc.).

Determine the starting packet number, source IP, destination IP, Jpeg file size. Paste this image into your Report

**Instruction.**

For initial data use **File / Export Object / HTTP ...** / sort information by file size (large to small) / find the N-th file content-jpeg / read interesting information / save this file.

**Answer.**

1.  Your variant Nr: ??

2.  Starting packet number:

3.  Source IP:

4.  Destination IP, jpeg file size:

5.  Jpeg file size:

6.  Picture

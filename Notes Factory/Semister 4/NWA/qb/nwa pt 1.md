***Q.9 State the difference between Hub and Switch (Min Four points) (4 marks)***
#answer
(do any 4, i have added 6 for flexbility)
### **Difference Between Hub and Switch**

| **Aspect** | **Hub** | **Switch** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Definition** | Hub is **not an intelligent device** as it forwards data to all connected devices without analyzing the destination. | Switch is **an intelligent device** as it forwards data only to the intended recipient using MAC address learning. |
| **Data Transmission & Collisions** |Can lead to network congestion and collisions. | Sends data only to the intended device, reducing congestion and preventing collisions. |
| **Speed & Bandwidth** | Works at a lower speed as bandwidth is shared among all devices. | Faster as each device gets dedicated bandwidth, improving performance. |
| **Duplex Mode & Network Efficiency** | Supports only **Half-Duplex**, allowing data to be sent or received but not both at the same time. | Supports **Full-Duplex**, enabling simultaneous sending and receiving of data, improving efficiency. |
| **Cost & Usage** | Cheaper and suitable for **small networks** with minimal data traffic. | More expensive but ideal for **large networks** requiring efficient data transfer. |
| **OSI Layer** | Operates at the **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**. | Operates at the **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)** or sometimes **Layer 3**. |
******

***Q.10 Explain Bridge, Switch and Router (4)***  
#answer  


A **Bridge** operates at the **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)** and connects multiple network segments, forwarding data based on **MAC addresses**. It helps reduce unnecessary traffic and improves network efficiency.

A **Switch** is an advanced bridge that also works at **Layer 2 (or Layer 3)**. It **intelligently forwards data** only to the intended device, preventing collisions and supporting **Full-Duplex communication** for better performance.

A **Router** operates at the **Network Layer (Layer 3)** and directs data between networks using **IP addresses**. It enables internet communication and provides **NAT, traffic filtering, and firewall functionalities**, making it essential for WANs.

***Q.11 Define ARP , RARP BOOTP and DHCP (4/6/8)***  
#answer  

**ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)** maps IP addresses to MAC addresses, allowing devices to communicate within the same network. It works by broadcasting a request to find the MAC address of a given IP address. Once received, the sender updates its ARP cache for future use. For example, when a device wants to send data on a local network, it uses ARP to find the recipient's MAC address.

**RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol)** performs the reverse of ARP by mapping MAC addresses to IP addresses. It is mainly used by diskless devices that do not have a stored IP address. The device sends a request, and a RARP server responds with the correct IP address. For example, a diskless workstation at startup uses RARP to get its IP address from a network server.


**BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol)** is a network protocol used to manually assign fixed IP addresses to devices, primarily for diskless computer systems and workstations. It does not support automatic configuration or temporary IP addressing, which can lead to errors due to manual setup. BOOTP is incompatible with DHCP users and has a lease period of 30 days. It is mainly utilized to provide essential network data to diskless systems.

**DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)** is a more advanced protocol that automatically assigns and manages IP addresses. It supports temporary IP allocation with a lease period (e.g., 1 day for Cisco routers and 8 days for Microsoft). Unlike BOOTP, DHCP prevents configuration errors, supports mobile devices, and is compatible with BOOTP users. It is widely used in networks to dynamically allocate and manage IP addresses efficiently.

***Q.12 Problems on IP Addressing (4/6)***  
#answer  


***
***Q.13 What are private and public addresses? Where do we use them? (4 marks)***
#answer
**Private IP addresses** are a set of IP addresses that are reserved for use within local networks (such as a home or an office). These addresses are not routable on the public internet, meaning devices with private IPs cannot be accessed directly from outside the local network.

- Network Address Translation (NAT) is often used to allow these devices to access the internet by mapping them to a public IP address.

the private address range is
    -   `10.0.0.0` to `10.255.255.255`
    -   `172.16.0.0` to `172.31.255.255`
    -   `192.168.0.0` to `192.168.255.255`



-   **Public Addresses** are unique IP addresses that are accessible over the internet. Any IP address that falls outside the private address ranges is considered public. These addresses are assigned to devices that need to be accessed from anywhere on the internet, such as web servers, email servers, or any other internet-facing service.

***Q.16 Explain with neat diagram the DORA process of DHCP (6 marks)***
#answer
![DHCP
](https://www.pynetlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-4.png)
### **DHCP DORA Process**

The **DORA** process consists of four steps that enable a DHCP client to obtain an IP address dynamically from a DHCP server.

1.  **Discover (D)**
    
    -   The **DHCP Client** broadcasts a **DHCP Discover** message to locate an available DHCP server.
    -   This message is sent as a broadcast because the client does not yet have an IP address.
2.  **Offer (O)**
    
    -   The **DHCP Server** responds with a **DHCP Offer** message, which contains an available IP address, subnet mask, gateway, lease duration, and other configuration details.
    -   The **Offer** is sent as a **unicast** directly to the client.
3.  **Request (R)**
    
    -   The **DHCP Client** sends a **DHCP Request** message to indicate that it accepts the offered IP address.
    -   This message is broadcast to inform other DHCP servers that it is accepting an offer from a specific server.
4.  **Acknowledge (A)**
    
    -   The **DHCP Server** sends a **DHCP Acknowledgment (ACK)** message, confirming the lease of the IP address to the client.
    -   The client can now use the assigned IP address to communicate on the network.

***Q.17 Draw and explain with flowchart the Address Negotiation Process of DHCP (8 marks)***
#answer
![image](.attachments/10b953b025f9e9316aea9d1bca0803088697381c.png) 

The DHCP address negotiation process is crucial for network connectivity which  automates IP address assignment by using the DORA sequence (Discover, Offer, Request, Acknowledge), a client initiates a broadcast (Discover) to locate DHCP servers. Servers respond with offered IP addresses (Offer). The client selects an offer and requests it specifically (Request), and the server confirms the assignment (Acknowledge). This dynamic negotiation prevents IP conflicts and streamlines network management.



1.  **Client Broadcasts Discovery:** A new device joins the network and sends a "DHCPDISCOVER" message to find a DHCP server.
    
2.  **Server Offers an IP:** A DHCP server receives the request and, if it has an available IP, sends a "DHCPOFFER" with a proposed IP address.
    
3.  **Client Requests the Offer:** The client chooses an offer and broadcasts a "DHCPREQUEST" to accept that specific IP address.
    
4.  **Server Confirms Assignment:** The server verifies the IP is still available and sends a "DHCPACK" to confirm the assignment to the client.
    
5.  **Client Checks for Conflicts:** The client uses ARP to make sure no other device is already using the assigned IP address.
    
6.  **Successful Binding or Decline:** If no conflict is found, the client uses the IP. If a conflict is detected, the client sends a "DHCPDECLINE" and the process restarts.

***Q.18 Draw and explain with flowchart the Lease Renewal Process of DHCP (8 marks)***
#answer

![image](.attachments/646c5af03051e0192edacb1ca8f862aabb33e4ca.jpg "Lease Renewal Process") 

This flowchart describes the process of DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) lease renewal, which allows a network device (client) to maintain its IP address without interruption. The process is designed to be robust, handling various scenarios including server availability and lease expiration.
 * Renewing State (T1): The client first attempts to renew its lease at time T1, before it expires. It unicasts a DHCPREQUEST directly to the server that originally granted the lease (binding server).
 * Binding Server Response:
   * Success: If the binding server is available and can renew the address, it responds with a DHCPACK, confirming the renewal and resetting the lease timer.
   * Failure: If the server is unavailable or cannot renew the address (e.g., the address is no longer available), it responds with a DHCPNAK, terminating the lease.
 * Rebinding State (T2): If the initial renewal attempt fails or the client doesn't receive a response before time T2 (a later time before lease expiration), it enters the rebinding state.
 * Broadcast Request: In the rebinding state, the client broadcasts a DHCPREQUEST, seeking any DHCP server that can renew its lease. This is crucial for handling situations where the original server is down.
 * Server Response:
   * Success: If any server responds with a DHCPACK, the client's lease is renewed.
   * Failure: If no server responds, the lease eventually expires, requiring the client to go through the initial DHCP discovery process to obtain a new IP address.

***
A **DNS query** follows a structured process. When a user enters a domain name in a browser, the request goes to a **recursive DNS resolver**, which checks its cache. If not found, it queries a **root DNS server**, which directs it to the **TLD server** (e.g., `.com`). The **TLD server** provides the **authoritative DNS server**, which returns the domain’s IP address. The resolver caches the response and sends the IP to the client, allowing the browser to connect to the destination server.

***Q.20 Define DNS and explain its working (explain all steps with example) (6/8 marks)***
#answer
The **Domain Name System (DNS)** is a process  that translates human-readable domain names (e.g., `example.com`) into numerical IP addresses (e.g., `192.168.1.1`). This process allows users to access websites without memorizing complex IP addresses.

    E --> F[Authoritative DNS Server returns IP]
    F --> G[Recursive Resolver caches IP & sends to client]
    G --> H[Browser establishes connection with website]


```
***
When a user types **`www.example.com`** in a browser, the query is sent to a **recursive DNS resolver**, which first checks its **cache** for a stored IP address. If the IP is found (**Yes - Cache Hit**), the resolver immediately returns the IP to the browser, allowing the website to load without further queries. If the IP is not found (**No - Cache Miss**), the resolver forwards the query to a **root DNS server**, which directs it to the relevant **Top-Level Domain (TLD) server** (e.g., `.com`). The **TLD server** then points to the **authoritative DNS server**, which provides the correct IP address. The resolver caches this IP for future use and sends it to the browser, which then establishes a connection with the destination server, successfully loading the website.

***Q.21 State the Role of Root DNS server, Authoritative DNS server, and TLD DNS Server (4/6/8 marks)***
#answer
```8 marks version```

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a process that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses, allowing users to access websites easily. It operates through a hierarchical structure involving multiple DNS servers, each playing a specific role in resolving domain names efficiently. The three key components of this system are the Root DNS Server, TLD DNS Server, and Authoritative DNS Server.

The Root DNS Server is the first step in the DNS resolution process. It does not store domain-specific IP addresses but directs queries to the appropriate Top-Level Domain (TLD) DNS Server based on the domain extension, such as .com, .org, or .edu. There are 13 globally distributed root servers, ensuring redundancy, fault tolerance, and efficient query handling. This server forms the backbone of the internet's DNS infrastructure, enabling the proper routing of domain resolution requests.

The TLD DNS Server manages domain names within a specific top-level domain (TLD), such as .com, .net, or .org. When a query reaches the TLD server, it does not provide the final IP address but instead directs the request to the Authoritative DNS Server responsible for the specific domain. This classification helps organize and streamline domain resolution, ensuring faster responses and reducing DNS query loads.

The Authoritative DNS Server is the final authority for a domain name. It stores and maintains the actual DNS records, including A (IPv4 address), AAAA (IPv6 address), MX (Mail Exchange), and CNAME (Canonical Name) records. When a request reaches the authoritative DNS server, it provides the correct IP address associated with the domain name, allowing the user's browser to establish a connection. This ensures that the domain resolution process is accurate, secure, and up to date.

Example of DNS Query Flow:

A user enters www.example.com in a web browser.

The request is sent to a Root DNS Server, which directs it to the .com TLD DNS Server.

The TLD DNS Server forwards the query to the Authoritative DNS Server for example.com.

The Authoritative DNS Server responds with the IP address of example.com.

The browser uses the IP address to establish a connection and load the website.


This structured DNS hierarchy ensures efficient, scalable, and secure domain resolution, enabling seamless access to websites across the internet.

***Q.22 Define routing and explain different types of Routing (4)***  
#answer  
### **Routing**

**Routing** is the process of determining the best path for data packets to travel from the source to the destination across networks. It ensures efficient communication between devices in different networks.

#### **Types of Routing:**

-   **Static Routing:** Manually configured routes that do not change. Suitable for **small, stable networks** but lacks adaptability.
-   **Dynamic Routing:** Uses routing protocols to update routes **automatically**. Common protocols include **RIP, OSPF, and EIGRP**. Ideal for **large, changing networks**.
-   **Default Routing:** A single predefined route used to forward packets when no specific route is found. Useful for **smaller networks connecting to a larger network**.
***
***Q.23 Define the terms Delivery, forwarding and Routing on Network Layer (4/6)***  
#answer  


#### **1. Delivery**

Delivery refers to the process of transferring data packets to their intended **final destination**. It can be classified into two types:

-   **Direct Delivery:** Occurs when the sender and receiver are on the **same network**, allowing the packet to reach the destination without intermediaries.
-   **Indirect Delivery:** Happens when the sender and receiver are on **different networks**, requiring packets to pass through one or more **routers**.

#### **2. Forwarding**

Forwarding is the process of **moving a packet** from one network interface to another **within a router**. It ensures that packets reach the correct next hop towards their destination. Key aspects include:

-   **Routing Table Lookup:** The router checks its **routing table** to determine the next hop.
-   **Efficient Packet Switching:** Forwarding ensures packets are sent through the most **efficient path** within a network.

#### **3. Routing**

Routing is the process of determining the **best path** for a packet to travel across multiple networks. It involves:

-   **Routing Protocols:** Such as **RIP, OSPF, and BGP**, which help routers build and maintain **dynamic routing tables**.
-   **Path Selection:** Choosing the most **efficient and reliable route** to ensure optimal data transmission.

***
***Q.24 Classify the routing protocols and explain IGP and EGP (4/6)***  
#answer  


Routing protocols are classified into two main types based on their area of operation:

#### **1. Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP)**

IGP operates **within a single Autonomous System (AS)**, such as an organization's internal network. It helps in efficient communication between routers inside the same AS. Common IGP protocols include:

-   **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)** – Uses **distance vector** routing.
-   **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)** – Uses **link-state** routing for better scalability.
-   **EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)** – A hybrid protocol combining features of both distance vector and link-state protocols.

#### **2. Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGP)**

EGP operates **between different Autonomous Systems**, facilitating communication across the internet. It helps in establishing connections between networks owned by **different organizations**. The most widely used EGP protocol is:

-   **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)** – Ensures efficient routing and traffic management between ISPs and large networks globally.

By using IGP for internal routing and EGP for external routing, networks maintain efficient **data transmission and internet connectivity**.
***
***Q.25 Explain the concept of metric routing (4)***  
#answer  

Metric routing is a method used by **routing protocols** to determine the **best path** for data packets based on specific criteria. A **metric** is a numerical value assigned to different paths, with the **lowest metric indicating the most efficient route**.

#### **Common Routing Metrics:**

-   **Hop Count:** Number of routers a packet passes through. _(Used in RIP)_
-   **Bandwidth:** Available data transfer rate on a path. _(Used in OSPF)_
-   **Delay:** Time taken for a packet to traverse the route.
-   **Cost:** Custom value set by network administrators based on network policies.
-   **Reliability:** Stability and consistency of a route over time.

#### **Example:**

Suppose a packet needs to travel from **Router A to Router D**, and there are two possible paths:

1.  **Path 1:** A → B → D (Hop Count = 2, Bandwidth = 100 Mbps)
2.  **Path 2:** A → C → D (Hop Count = 2, Bandwidth = 50 Mbps)

If **RIP** is used, both paths have the same **hop count**, so either can be chosen. However, if **OSPF** is used, **Path 1** will be preferred because it has a **higher bandwidth (100 Mbps)**, making it more efficient.
***
***Q.26 Explain RIP, write steps to configure it. (6/8)***  
#answer  

Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is a **distance-vector routing protocol** used in IPv4 (**RIPv1, RIPv2**) and IPv6 (**RIPng**) networks. It determines the best route using **hop count** as a metric, with a **maximum hop limit of 15** to prevent routing loops. RIP updates its routing table **every 30 seconds** by broadcasting its table to neighboring routers.

#### **Example:**

Consider a network with three routers (**R1, R2, and R3**). If **R1** needs to send data to **R3**, it checks its **routing table**:



   `R1 -------- R2 -------- R3                 `

#### **Routing Table for R1**

| **Destination** | **Next Hop** | **Hop Count** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R2  | Direct | 1   |
| R3  | R2  | 2   |

#### **Routing Table for R2**

| **Destination** | **Next Hop** | **Hop Count** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R1  | Direct | 1   |
| R3  | Direct | 1   |

#### **Routing Table for R3**
| **Destination** | **Next Hop** | **Hop Count** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R2  | Direct | 1   |
| R1  | R2  | 2   |

-   If **R3 is reachable via R2** with a hop count of **1**, R1 forwards the data to R2.
-   If **R3 is directly connected to R1**, the hop count is **0**, and data is sent directly.
-   If multiple paths exist, **RIP selects the route with the fewest hops**.

Though **RIP is simple**, it suffers from **slow convergence** and the **count-to-infinity problem**. These issues are addressed in **RIP v2** and alternative protocols like **OSPF**, which offer better scalability and efficiency.

#answer  

![image](.attachments/0a8ee97fc1bd28a31a168f2fa6c07c08129e6c08.png) 
The **Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)** protocol is a link-state routing protocol used in **IP networks**. It ensures efficient routing by maintaining a complete topology of the network within an autonomous system (AS). The OSPF message format consists of multiple fields to facilitate communication between routers.

***

### **OSPF Message Format:**



1.  **Version (8 bits)** – Indicates the OSPF version being used. (e.g., OSPFv2 = 2, OSPFv3 = 3)
2.  **Type (8 bits)** – Specifies the OSPF packet type (Hello, Database Description, Link State Request, etc.).
3.  **Message Length (16 bits)** – Defines the total length of the OSPF message, including the header.
4.  **Source IP Address** – The IP address of the router sending the OSPF message.
5.  **Area Identification** – Identifies the OSPF area the router belongs to, ensuring correct routing updates.
6.  **Checksum** – Provides error detection to ensure data integrity.
7.  **Authentication Type (Auth. Type)** – Specifies the method used for authentication (e.g., Null, Simple Password, MD5).
8.  **Authentication (32 bits)** – Contains the authentication information required for secure OSPF communication.

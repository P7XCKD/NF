## PRP EXPERIMENT 1

### Aim: To install Python and to run a ‘Hello World’ script.



### LEARNING OUTCOMES (LO):
- Install and configure Python on a Windows-based machine.  
- Write and execute a “Hello World” program using the Python shell, text editor, and IDE.



### Theory:
Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built-in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for rapid application development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.  

Key features of Python:  
- Simple, easy to learn, and readable syntax, reducing programming maintenance costs.  
- Supports modules and packages, encouraging modularity and code reuse.  
- Available for free in source or binary form for all major platforms, along with an extensive standard library.



### Procedure:

#### Steps to Install Python on Windows:
1. **Select version of Python to install:**  
   - Download the official Python `.exe` installer from the Python website.  
   - Choose the version based on your needs.

2. **Download Python executable installer:**  
   - Visit the official Python website and go to the *Downloads for Windows* section.  
   - Download the Windows x86 executable installer of the desired Python version.  

3. **Run the executable installer:**  
   - Launch the downloaded Python installer.  
   - Select the checkboxes for **Install launcher for all users** and **Add Python 3.10 to PATH**, then click **Install Now**.  
   - After installation, enable the option to bypass the 260-character `MAX_PATH` limit for Python to use long path names.  

4. **Verify Python installation on Windows:**  
   - Navigate to the installation directory and double-click on the Python `.exe` file.  
   - A Command Prompt will open, displaying the installed Python version.

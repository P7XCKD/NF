**Experiment 6: Caesar Cipher Implementation**

**Aim:** To implement the Caesar Cipher, demonstrating both single-shift and multi-level shift and keyword cipher.

**Theory:**

The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. It's a foundational example of symmetric encryption.

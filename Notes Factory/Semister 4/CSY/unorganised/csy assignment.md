Cyber Crime (2 Marks)

Cybercrime refers to illegal activities conducted using digital devices or networks. These crimes include hacking, online fraud, identity theft, and cyberstalking. Cybercriminals exploit vulnerabilities in systems and personal data, leading to financial loss, data breaches, and privacy violations. With the rise of digital transactions and online communication, cybercrime has become a significant threat to individuals and organizations.

Hacking and Digital Forgery (4 Marks)

Hacking is the unauthorized access to computer systems, networks, or data with malicious intent. Hackers may exploit security vulnerabilities to steal sensitive information, disrupt services, or cause financial damage. There are different types of hacking, including ethical hacking (legal) and black-hat hacking (illegal).

Digital forgery involves altering or fabricating digital documents, signatures, images, or credentials to commit fraud. It is commonly used in identity theft, document forgery, and financial fraud. Advanced tools like deepfake technology have further increased the risk of digital forgery, making it harder to differentiate between real and fake digital content.

Cyber Stalking (4 Marks)

Cyberstalking is the use of digital platforms to harass, intimidate, or monitor an individual repeatedly. It includes sending threatening messages, spreading false information, tracking online activities, or hacking personal accounts. Cyberstalkers often target victims through social media, emails, or messaging apps, causing psychological distress and fear. In severe cases, cyberstalking can escalate to physical threats or identity theft. Many countries have laws against cyberstalking to protect victims and penalize offenders.

Cyber Harassment (3 Marks)

Cyber harassment involves using digital means to threaten, abuse, or humiliate individuals. This includes cyberbullying, hate speech, online defamation, and sharing inappropriate content without consent. Unlike cyberstalking, cyber harassment may not involve continuous monitoring but can have a severe emotional and reputational impact. Social media platforms are common mediums for cyber harassment, and legal measures exist to penalize offenders and protect victims.

Identity Theft and Cyber Terrorism (4 Marks)

Identity theft occurs when someone unlawfully obtains and misuses another person’s personal data, such as credit card details, social security numbers, or online credentials, for financial gain or fraud. Cybercriminals use phishing, malware, and data breaches to steal identities and commit crimes like bank fraud or fake transactions.

Cyber terrorism involves using digital attacks to create fear, disrupt critical infrastructure, or harm governments and organizations. Terrorist groups exploit cyber tools for propaganda, recruitment, and financial transactions. Cyber terrorism poses a significant national security threat, requiring global cybersecurity measures and counter-terrorism strategies.

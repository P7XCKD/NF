## **Section A (4 Marks Each) [Attempt Any 4]**  
*(Only 1 question from Chapter 1, rest from Chapter 3)*  

| Q.No | Question | Chapter | Probability (%) |
|------|----------|---------|----------------|
| 1 | Explain **Process Context Switch** with a neat diagram. | Chapter 1 | 60% |
| 2 | Explain **Race Condition** with an example. | Chapter 3 | 70% |
| 3 | Describe the **Requirements of Synchronization Mechanisms**. | Chapter 3 | 75% |
| 4 | Explain **Binary Semaphore** with an example. | Chapter 3 | 80% |
| 5 | Differentiate between **Starvation and Deadlock**. | Chapter 3 | 85% |

## **Section B (6 Marks Each) [Attempt Any 1]**  
*(Mid-level difficulty, majorly from Chapter 2, includes numerical problem)*  

| Q.No | Question | Chapter | Probability (%) |
|------|----------|---------|----------------|
| 6 | Explain **Types of Process Schedulers** in detail. | Chapter 2 | 65% |
| 7 | Solve a numerical on **Scheduling Algorithms (FCFS, SJF, Priority, Round Robin)** by calculating **CT, TAT, WT, RT**. (**Numerical-based**) | Chapter 2 | 90% |

---

## **Section C (8 Marks Each) [Attempt Any 1]**  
*(Majorly from Chapter 3, sum-based question included)*  

| Q.No | Question | Chapter | Probability (%) |
|------|----------|---------|----------------|
| 8 | Explain the **Producer-Consumer Problem** with a suitable solution. | Chapter 3 | 75% |
| 9 | Solve a numerical problem on **Deadlock Detection using Resource Allocation Graph**. (**Numerical-based**) | Chapter 3 | 95% |

## **Total Marks: 30**  
### **Breakdown:**  
- **Chapter 1** → 1 question (low weightage).  
- **Chapter 2** → 1 theoretical + 1 numerical question.  
- **Chapter 3** → 3 theory + 1 numerical in Section A, 1 large theory + 1 numerical in Section C.  
- **50% numerical-based**: Questions 7 & 9.  
- Higher **probability questions (≥ 70%)** are more likely to appear in the exam.
